          <h2>Work</h2>
          <p>
            I was working as a commercial Union HVAC tech/Sheet Metal worker up until September 1st.
            That is when I took a job in the Union Office as a Business Reprasenative/Organizer. So I now work out of the 
            office, mostly on the phone or in front of a computer all day. I am looking forward to the new challenges that 
            will come from this position, plus I get to use some of the skills I have gained from my courses at
            Southwestern now.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
              When I am not working I enjoy spending time with the family, hanging out with friends, barbequeing, and golfing.
              I do not get to do any of these activities as nearly often as I would like. But one day I am sure life will slow
              down and I will get to enjoy more of it.
